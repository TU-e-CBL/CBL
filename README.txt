# Setagaya house
This game reinacts the happenings on December 30th 2000 in a Japanese city called Setagaya. The Miyazawa family was brutally murdered in the late evening. This well liked family of 4 consisted of father, Mikio, mother, Yasuko, 6-year-old Rei and 8-year old Niina. Rei was the first victim and got strangled to death by the perpetrator. You play as a shadow of Rei, who is still alive, but not for long. As you progress through the house, the player may predict what will happen.
